> #Calculate the square root of 625, divide it by 5, and assign it to variable x.Ex: y= log10(1000)/5, the previous statement takes log10 of 1000, divides it by 5, and assigns the value to variable y. [Difficulty: Beginner]

KEY CONCEPT: results of computations or arbitrary values can be stored in variables we can re-use those variables later on and over-write them with new values. [Difficulty: Beginner]
